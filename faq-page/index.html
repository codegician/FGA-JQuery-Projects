        <h1 class="question">1. What is jQuery?</h1>
        <p class="answer">
            jQuery is a JavaScript framework, which purpose is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. You could also describe jQuery as an abstraction layer, since it takes a lot of the functionality that you would have to write many lines of JavaScript to accomplish and wraps it into functions that you can call with a single line of code.
        </p>

        <h1 class="question">2. Do I need to know JavaScript to use jQuery?</h1>
        <p class="answer">
            No, you don't need to know JavaScript to use jQuery. In fact, jQuery tries to simplify a lot of the complicated things with JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation, so that you may do these things without knowing JavaScript.
        </p>

        <h1 class="question">3. Does jQuery replace JavsScript?</h1>
        <p class="answer">
            jQuery does NOT replace JavaScript, and while it does offer some syntactical shortcuts, the code you write when you use jQuery is still JavaScript code.
